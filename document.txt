1. In React application can be divided into Components. One is App Component that is application
component and other components are child component of it.

2. Like for twitter app, App component can be breaken into NavBar, Profile, Trends, Feed.
and Feed component can be breaken into Tweet and Like.

3. A component is implemented in form of Javascript class and each class has some state and 
render method. state is data that we want to display when render method is called. and render method
tells what ui should look like. 

4. Output of render method is ReactElement which is simple Javascript Object that maps to DOMElement.

5. React keeps lightweight representation of DOM in form of DOMElement. It is also called VirtualDOM.
when we change state of component, we get new ReactElement. Then children of this new ReactElement,
checks what is changed, and update DOMElement children accordingly to be in sync with changes.

6. React called react because once state changes, React react to it and updates the DOM.

7. Both React and Angular are same in terms of component based architecture however Angular is 
Framework a complete solution while react is library. React responsibility is to render view and
ensure view is in sync with different state of application.

8. To start working with it we have installed 2 extensions:
-> Simple React Snippets by burke holland
-> Prettier - Code formatter by Esben Petersen
-> Go to File > Preference > Setting and from there set "Format on Save"

9. You need to install npm package create-react-app.

10. Once you creatr app by create-react-app you get Development Server, Webpack and Babel.
Babel is toolchain that is mainly used to convert ECMAScript 2015+ code into a backwards compatible version of JavaScript in current and older browsers or environments. 
Transform syntax
Polyfill features that are missing in your target environment (through @babel/polyfill)
Source code transformations (codemods)
